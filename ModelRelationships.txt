---+ Relationship to relevant (feature) models
---++ HY_Features

HY_Features model has some logical connection points through the related features in the HY_SurfaceWaterBody package: E.g. HY_River, Reach etc. There is also a HY_CrossSection which provides some geometric properties (area) and the reach geometry:

If sections are included in the scope it would be possible to relate some relevant features here. 
---++ INSPIRE

INSPIRE is similarly focussed on the network structure and topology, but does identify core featuers that are relevant. E.g. water courses, physical features and man-made features (embankments, fords, dams etc.). All these types of objects are able to carry geometries but specifics are not defined.
