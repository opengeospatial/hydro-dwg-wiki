---++ <b> Issues - Resolved<br /></b>

I have prepared initial version of UML model for GWML 2.0. I think it is good start point for discussion about our further works.
It in EAP file is attached below ( [[%ATTACHURL%/GW2IE_GWML_v2.0.initial.zip][GW2IE_GWML_v2.0.initial.zip]] ). All class diagrams are in docx file ( [[%ATTACHURL%/GWML_v.2.0.initial_Diagrams.docx][GWML_v.2.0.initial_Diagrams.docx]] ).

-- Main.JanuszMichalak - 08 Apr 2013

I've attached a zipped version of the xmi for the GWML2 logical model that we produced at Vienna. This still requires checking all the stereotypes, tagged values (including sequenceNumber) and association types prior to generating the XSD.

---+++ Springs - Resolved

Some issues with the GW_Spring feature in the logical model:

<img alt="GW_Spring.jpg" height="211" src="%ATTACHURL%/GW_Spring.jpg" title="GW_Spring.jpg" width="296" />

What is the SpringConstruction data type? RESOLVED (see below)

What is the Geology Data type ( = GeoSciML:GeologicUnit?) RESOLVED (GeoSciML:GeologicFeature)

-- Main.BruceSimons - 15 May 2014

Spring types are shown in the figure below, taken from Fetter C.W. 2001 Applied Hydrogeology, 4th ed., Prentice Hall

<img alt="" height="484" src="%ATTACHURL%/springs.jpg" width="530" />

The Spring Geology relates to the geological outcrop at the eye of the spring. For example, the Contact Spring has a different geological unit above and below the spring.

The Spring Construction refers to the modification made at the spring eye, for example the addition of a hand pump, or bore, or concrete pit into which the spring flows, etc.

-- Main.PeterDahlhaus - 15 May 2014

At the moment the UML has a single GeoSciML:GeologicUnit data type. From Peter's discussion this should probably be changed to GeoSciML:GeologicFeature with 0..* cardinality. This would enable describing the geology at the Spring fully (all GeologicUnits, their relationships to each other as well as any associated Geologic Structures such as faults Joints etc). DONE

-- Main.BruceSimons - 15 May 2014

Can we reuse WellConstruction ? I think so, but someone who knows about 'Spring Constructions' should check against the UML. -- Main.BruceSimons - 15 May 2014 RESOLVED (See below)

---+++ Resolved Logical Model Issues

Known issues that need fixing prior to XSD generation:
   1 Circularity between Core and Wells. I'm not sure why GroundWaterML2 -Core is importing GroundWaterML -Well. The circularity needs to be removed somehow.
      * _TO DO: Francois to review and advise at June 25 meeting [BB 2014-06-10]_

      * _TO DO: to be reviewed by Francois / Bruce [BB 2014-07-07]_
      * _RESOLVED: Generated new dependency diagrams and all 'looks' OK. Deleted dependency between gwml:Well and GeoSciML:Borehole (presuming it was left over from Conceptual Model) [BS 2014-07-08]_

   1 GW_Spring:gwSpringConstruction data type needs sorting out. Should it point to GroundWaterML2 -WellConstruction feature WellConstruction?
      * _RESOLVED: data type = AnyType; range of this property is too wide to fix to a limited set of terms, so opted for maximum flexibility [BB 2014-06-10]_
   1 GroundWaterML2 -WellConstruction feature property types and tagged values have not been fully checked.

More issues in the Logical Model:
   * GW_ManagementArea:gwAreaYield property has description:<br />"Type of yields (of the aquifer or management area): e.g. specific yield, safe yield, license yield etc. but excludes well yield. TBD"<br />However, the !DataType is OM_Measurement, indicating it should be the actual yield measurement (value). <br />Do we need another property capturing the gwYieldType, or do we intend using the OM_Observation:parameter property to capture the yield type?
      * _RESOLVED: we discussed using the parameter property for all such attributes [BB - 2014-06-04]_
   * What is GW_ManagementArea:gwAreaWaterBudget for? There are no notes in the Logical Model.Does this relate to GW_ManagementArea:gwAreaYield?
      * _RESOLVED: this is a water budget for the management area (which can be distinct from an aquifer); not yield, it represents the net flow balance in the area [BB - 2014-06-04]_
   * I'm not sure how to encode administrative licencing information (e.g. licence under which drilling took place). The MD_Metadata model looks like it only deals with data release licencing. Do we need a GW_Well:gwLicence property?
      * _TO DO: Francois and Bruce to review and advise at next meeting (June 25) [BB 2014-06-10]_
         * _TO DO: review Regulation package and possible inclusion of ManagementArea [BB 2014-06-25]_

Following up on the screen dimensions question. In our national database (NWIS) we record the length of the screen and a single diameter.

Here's how a Record works in SWE. Actually, swe calls it a DataRecord which is an encoding of ISO 11404 Record.

</gww:LogValue>

</verbatim>

Note the gww:value bit. it contains a DataRecord with a definition attribute. This must contain a URI that leads to "the semantic definition of the precise nature of the component.", ie, to the schema, that can be described using SWE (defined in 08-094r1). There are lot of possibilities, for instance, replace the bland text with a category
<verbatim>
<gww:value>
		<swe:DataRecord definition="http://this.is.where.the.schema.is.defined" id="a">
			<swe:field name="lithology">
				<swe:Category definition="ref to definition of EarthMaterial catagory">
					<swe:codeSpace xlink:href="geosciml codespace"/>
					<swe:value>Soil</swe:value>
				</swe:Category>
			</swe:field>
		</swe:DataRecord>
	</gww:value></verbatim>

The definition of the schema (definition attribute) can be imposed in the spec and defined formally in a registry (like a vocabulary). This allows group to add their own structure an register their structure without changing the schema of GWML.

---+++ Well::LogValue:value/DataRecord:field/AnyData is swe 1.0 - Resolved

The DataRecord used for GSML2:WellLogValue:value is a swe 1.0 class. I think it should be the swe 2.0 equivalent. If so, the DataRecord:field property should use the AbstractDataComponent DataType rather than the AnyData DatatYpe we are currently using.

---+++ Optional vs. Mandatory (Nillable) properties - Resolved
---++++ Background

The intention of having mandatory properties in the UML is to show where properties are required for the model to be logically consistent. So, for example, a pore space or void (GW_HydrogeoVoid) must have some surrounding material (the GW_HydrogeoUnit) so the property identifying the surrounding material (gwVoidUnit) has a cardinality of 1..*, but the material need not contain voids, so the reverse property (gwUnitVoid) has a cardinality of 0..1. Similarly, a void may contain a fluid (the property gwVoidFluidBody with cardinality 0..1) but the fluid must be contained by voids (gwFluidBodyVoid cardinality of 1..1).

<img alt="Cardinalities.jpg" height="344" src="%ATTACHURL%/Cardinalities.jpg" title="Cardinalities.jpg" width="531" />

Similarly, it is logically consistent for a spatial feature, such as the GW_ManagementArea to have a geometry property (gwAreaShape), or for fluids to have physical properties.

In order for data providers who may not be able to meet these mandatory requirements for a number of reasons (such as missing, confidential or unknown data), the mandatory values may be voidable. So in the UML there are 3 cases:
   1 The property is logically expected and not voidable {For example GW_ManagementArea/gwAreaShape}
   1 The property is logically expected but voidable {For example GW_ManagementArea/gwAreaFeature}
   1 The property is appropriate, but it may or may not be present {For example GW_ManagementArea/gwAreaMetadata}
<img alt="GW_ManagementArea.jpg" height="229" src="%ATTACHURL%/GW_ManagementArea.jpg" title="GW_ManagementArea.jpg" width="293" />
---++++ The Issue

The logical model cardinalities represent the conceptual requirements "and these would be used as constraints (say, schematron) for data exchange scenarios: ‘your submitted data is not acceptable as it does not include values for the following properties: …’ (Main.AlistairRitchie 2014).

However, it does not meet the use case where the end-user may just be interested in a single property, such as the name of the GW_Aquifer or the management area licence. Using the current GWML2 implementation all mandatory properties, including those which are voidable, will need to be returned, which substantially increases the volume of XML being delivered. This may be inappropriate for some applications, such as mobile devices.

With all properties optional, the user can query the WFS using the request=GetFeature, typeName={feature}, propertyName={attribute} to limit the content. For example requesting the complete GW_Well feature

[WFS URI]?service=wfs&version=2.0.0&request=GetFeature&count=1&typename=gww:GW_Well would return (with lots deleted at &lt;snip&gt;):

   </gww:GW_Well>
 </gml:featureMember></verbatim>

However, with mandatory properties this second response would not be XML schema valid.
---++++ Proposal

The proposal is to change all mandatory properties to optional. This would require:
   * systematically working through the GWML2 logical model and changing all 1..x cardinalities to 0..x;
   * change all minOccurs="1" to minOccurs="0" in all the GWML2 schema;
An alternative is to only change some properties from mandatory to optional. However, given the three criteria currently used to determine cardinality (see 'Background' above), it is not clear what further criteria could be used to determine which properties should remain mandatory.
---++++ Concerns
   1 If all properties are optional, how do we meet the data exchange use case? Do we need two logical models and associated schema to identify the properties that should be mandatory for data exchange and another set for the optional view;
   1 Is schema validation a necessary requirement for the optional use case?
   1 Mandatory properties inherited from imported features (OM_Observation, GeologicUnit, etc) will still be mandatory, so a single property response is still likely to be XML schema invalid.
Given these concerns, is the best option to leave the model as is and just recognise that some uses of GWML2 will use invalid XML schema responses?

-- Main.BruceSimons - 17 Nov 2014 {This proposal and the issues presented here resulted from a number of conversations with Main.AlistairRitchie of Landcare Research NZ}

&gt;If all properties are optional, how do we meet the data exchange use case?

Ok, here a proposition, Maybe the pattern should be
   * XSD is essentially there to control the syntax "If you have this property, this is where is goes". All properties are optional.
   * Use case requirements are expressed in a Rule based languages, such as Schematron. Since there are so many possible use cases, schematron (or whatever) is probably the best way to express rules for particular uses case. So, one use case is defined by a series of rules regarding expected content to fullfill the use case.
   * Schema validation is there to ensure that stuff is at the right placs (if present). Schematron (or whatever) is there to check if the stuff needed for a use case is there.
   * It also means that we should be sure that "InlineOrByReference" is alway "both", an let the use case decide.
   * _Mandatory properties inherited from imported features_ : There is actually a way to override (redefine) cardinality in XSD : see http://wiki.services.eoportal.org/tiki-view_forum_thread.php?comments_parentId=1370&display=print - never tried it, but apparently XSD leggit.
My two snowy cents.

-- Main.EricBoisvert - 18 Nov 2014

Quite elegant. Allows meeting multiple use cases by using Schematron rather than attempting to use schema profiling. Adds an extra 'layer' in the validation process, but I think this is a good thing as it separates the structure validation, from the content validation, where content is both the presence or absence of a property, as well as its value.

---++ Outstanding Logical Model Issues
   * CM: part role names and cardinalities require editing
   * CM: needs GW_Licence class
   * LM: well construction package needs documentation
---+++ Downhole Observations

*How should we encode downhole GW_FluidBody and GW_HydrogeoUnit observations?*

GW_Well has:

gwWellBody to describe (either in-line or byReference) the GW_FluidBody. This could include observations on the chemistry of the fluid body at certain depths down the well.

gwWellUnit to describe (either in-line or byReference) the GW_HydrogeoUnit. This could include descriptions of the lithology or stratigraphy at certain depths down the well.

gwWellGeology to describe how a property (such as lithology, stratigraphy or hydrochemistry) varies down the well by using OM_Observation.

The problem is how to specify the depths that the GW_FluidBody and GW_HydrogeoUnit occur down the well.

I propose that for GW_HydrogeoUnit:
   * gwWellGeology is used to specify the depths for the geological information (lithology, stratigraphy), with the om:featureOfInterest the GW_HydrogeoUnit
   * gwWellUnit may also provide geological information (lithology, stratigraphy) via the inherited GeoSciML GeologicUnit. Normally this would be the more general description of the GW_HydrogeoUnit from numerous wells and outcrops, but may be just for this GW_Well. If so, it would duplicate the gwWellGeology result.
   * GW_HydrogeoUnit has its spatial representation specified by the GeoSciML occurrence:MappedFeature property. Where the GW_HydrogeoUnit is only known from this well then the MappedFeature geometry (gml:LineString) should be the GW_HydrogeoUnit depth down the well, with the gsml:MappedFeature/gsml:shape, its srsName and gsml:samplingFrame all being the GW_Well:shape.
   * This will allow linking the downhole geological observations to any descriptions of the other geological and hydrogeological properties of the GW_HydrogeoUnit
For GW_FluidBody the same as GW_HydrogeoUnit would apply (chemical observations downhole as gwWellgeology with the featureOfInterest the GW_FluidBody) except that:
   * GW_FluidBody does not have gsml:MappedFeature/gsml:shape but has gwml2:gwBodyShape (datatype = GM_Object). So where we are only describing the GW_FluidBody in this particular well, the gwml2:gwBodyShape should be the GW_FluidBody depth down the well, with the gwml2:gwBodyShape gml:LineString and srsName being the GW_Well:shape.
   * This will allow linking the downhole fluid body observations to descriptions of the the GW_FluidBody. This is necessary to be able to describe for example the chemical constituents at a particular depth ( a feature view rather than an observation view).
-- Main.BruceSimons - 20 Aug 2014
---+++ GW_FluidBody - GW_Mixture

For GWFluidBody, gwBodyConstituent/GW_Mixture describes the individual 'groups' of constituents (biological, chemical or material) based on their mixture status (e.g. those in solution as one gwBodyConstituent, those in suspension another, colloidal another and suspension another). For each mixture type GW_ConstituentRelation allows describing the relationships between the various constituents. Is this how we want it to work? Or should the gwMixture property be on the GW_Constituent Class so a GW_FluidBody/gwBodyConstituent can be made up of various mixtures?

-- Main.BruceSimons - 20 Aug 2014
---+++ GW_BiologicalConstituent/gwState

GW_BiologicalConstituent/gwState is repeated in GW_BiologicalConstituent instead of being a constraint on the GW_Constiituent/gwState.

-- Main.BruceSimons - 25 Aug 2014
---+++ Reference Elevation - resolved (I think - BS)
   * BS: Are the cardinalities on GW_Well:gwWellReferenceElevation [1..*] correct? If so how to specify which gwWellReferenceElevation to use for the various depth properties? -- Main.BruceSimons - 13 Aug 2014
      * Clause /req/gwml2-well/origin_elevation states that one of the Elevation must be flagged as the "reference elevation" -- Main.EricBoisvert - 10 Dec 2014
   * BS: Are the cardinalities on BoreCollar:collarElevation [1..*] correct? If so which does ConstructionComponent:from and to refer to? -- Main.BruceSimons - 13 Aug 2014
   * BS: Federation University collect Well condition data at various times over the life of the well - well depth from surface, well-depth from collar, casing height. It looks like GW_Well only allows a single value for well depth (gwWellConstructedDepth) and casing height (bholeHeadworks). -- Main.BruceSimons - 18 Aug 2014
      * Wow. this means the reference points actually moves over time. If we open this pandora box, this mean we must consider all properties that can change over time

As both Well and Borehole are types of SF_SamplingCurve they should use the same pattern for specifying the reference elevation. This could be readily achieved by adding a BoreCollar /elevationType property as per Well:Elevation/elevationType (subject to resolution of 1. Inconsistency between Specification Section 9.5.1 and UML elevationType documentation).

OK.. this is the bit that disapeared (don't remember why) from the spec.

| /req/gwml2-construction/construction_geometry_origin | <span>The origin of the relative position shall be the first vertex of the Borehole shape</span> |
<b> <span style="background-color: transparent;">If the borehole is associated with a well, they should share the same shape</span></b>

It says that the Borehole's shape property shall be a xlink:href to the Well's shape (semantically sharing the same geometry). By way of consequence, the collar of reference will be located at the same place as the well reference elevation (because they follow the same rules). We need this to insure package dependency, so a Construction package cannot import Well (we might want to use construction in Oil industry for instance). The rule when you need to link construction to another Linear feature is the share this feature. Element are alway linearly located from the first vertext of the shape, and the reference elevation is also the first vertex, so is the 2D location of the well. It's all about synchronising multiple geometried all derived from the first vertex of the shape. If this is ok with you, I'll bring it back in the spec - or I'll get my asbestos suit..

<span style="color: #339900; font-size: 17px; line-height: 1.1em; background-color: transparent;">Discussion on how to encode having a compound result without an OM_ComplexObservation</span>

There is a bit more into this. The Pump Test fit quite nicely into the concept of Observation except that any observation is about gwFuildBodyUnit.. the *association* between GW_HydroUnit and GW_FluidBody. Observation are normally about a feature (through featureOfInterest or indirectly through the sampling feature sampledFeature property). GW_UnitFluidProperty is not a feature either (it has no identity). One pattern we have , proposed by Simon is to use the procedure to unambiguously refer to the pair of sampledFeature (GW_HydroUnit and GW_FluidBody) here: SamplingFeature  , at the bottom of the page.

As for complex results, SWE can deal with this the same way we did for logs and coverages.

---+++ bholeDrillingMethod cardinality

GWML2 only allows for a cardinality of [0..1]. Australian NGIS database has [0..*]. -- Main.BruceSimons - 02 Feb 2015
---++++ Pattern required over properties of SamplingFeature /Observation

SamplingFeature has two generic properties that interferes with some of the properties we have with WaterWell
   * sampledFeature links to the real world features sampled by the SamplingFeature, but we also have gwWellBody and gwWellUnit properties that overlaps this semantic (it just adds constrain - but does not prevent usage of sampledFeature)
   * relatedObservation links to any observations, but we also have a series of properties that does the same thing (gwWellConstructedDepth, gWellStaticWaterDepth)
We should probably document why use custom properties over generic sampledFeature / relatedObservation (probably around more constrained semantic)
