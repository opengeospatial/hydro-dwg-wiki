---++Notes
   * *WaterML 2 Design Issues:*
      * Conceptual model for Sampling and Sampled Features for gr and surface water 
      * Nested Sampling and Sampled Feature
      * Content profile to determine what to put in the Sampled and Sampled Feature boxes for gr/water
      * Some result possibilities: 
         * !TimeSeries (one sensor, many times, one phenomena type, many values)
         * Quality (one sensor, one time, many phenomena type, one value)
         * need conceptual model for consistent results

   * *OGC Web Services Issues:*
      * use-case for sensor data discovery that is not visual based

   * *Next Milestones:*
      * March 2010
         * query using temporal filter, value filter, sampled features  (GSC, USGS)
         * return WFS results in GWML for wells (USGS)
         * constrain results model in !WaterML2 schema via schema or usage profile 
         * complete !WaterML 2 design re: feature-of-interest (sampled/sampling feature)
      * June 2010
         * SOS return new results schema
         * CSW prototype for services as well as sensor metadata (including discovery use-case)
