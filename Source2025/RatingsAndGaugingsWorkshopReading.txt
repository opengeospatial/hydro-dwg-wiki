20-22 June 2012<br />The University of Reading<br />The Conference is no. 176 which is on the first floor of the Harry Pitt Building. <br />School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences Harry Pitt Building, 3 Earley Gate<br />Campus details are attached at the <a href="http://external.opengis.org/twiki_public/HydrologyDWG/ReadingWorkshop2012" title="HDWM workshop page">HDWG workshop page</a>
---++ Internet connection

The venue has wireless internet connectivity available for participants via eduroam. Visitors from outside the university can use Eduroam if their institution is part of the Eduroam Federation (http://www.eduroam.org/).<br />If you do not have an eduroam account then there is no wireless network access available. We are organising to have a few LAN connections available during the RGS workshop. Hope fully the LAN connection can be shared either through a wired or wireless hub, we are awaiting detail on this. I suggest RGS participants bring a LAN patch cable (4-6m) just incase wireless sharing is not permitted.
