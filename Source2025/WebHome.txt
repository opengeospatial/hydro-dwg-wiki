---+!! Welcome to the Hydrology Domain Working Group

---++ Overview

The ability to easily exchange water information in a timely and useful fashion is becoming increasingly important. Water information in general, is both highly spatial and highly temporal in nature. Water information is also an exemplar of the kinds of environmental information that is required to be shared across organizational and jurisdictional boundaries, which is facilitated by OGC's interoperability standards.

The Hydrology Domain Working Group is a domain working group in the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). It brings together interested parties to develop and promote the technology for greatly improving the way in which water information is described and shared. This working group is to be hosted by the OGC and co-chaired by a representative from the World Meteorological Organisations (WMO) ommission for Observation, Infrastructure and Information Systems (INFCOM). The Hydrology Domain Working Group will coordinate efforts with other earth science DWGs (Meteorology, Oceans, etc) through the Earth System Science DWG.

The purpose of the Hydro DWG is to provide a venue and mechanism for seeking technical and institutional solutions to the challenge of describing and exchanging data describing the state and location of water resources, both above and below the ground surface. The path to adoption will be through OGC papers and standards, advanced to ISO where appropriate, and also through the World Meteorological Organizations (WMO) Commission for Observation, Infrastructure and Information Systems (INFCOM), mainly through JET-HYDMON. While WMO Technical Commissions have the recognized mandate to publish and promote standards in this area, OGC contributes to the process with its resources and experience in guiding collaborative development among disparate participants in a rapidly evolving technological environment. It is proposed that the OGC Hydrology DWG will provide a means of developing candidate standards for submission to ISO and for adoption by INFCOM as appropriate.

The Hydro DWG is intended to be a public forum for communication, and both the [[https://lists.opengeospatial.org/mailman/listinfo/hydro.dwg][email list]] and this wiki are open to interested parties.
