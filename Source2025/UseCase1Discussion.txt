I think this use case should be expanded to allow for the investigation of gw quality in an area as a member of the public would be just as interested in quality as they are in quantity. I understand that the IE is not focusing on water quality information as it is being addressed by other groups, but we may still want to include these requrements in our use cases.

Regarding water quality discussion, the water quality for public use shoud be easily understandable and not really consist of detailed chemical and microbial et al details, right? So rather a quality field/attribute for the entities, than a full-fledged water quality "report"? I also added a related comment on GwIe2UseCase3Discussion
