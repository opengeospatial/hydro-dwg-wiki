---+++ Feature Model

This page is for technical discussions on Feature Models to be used as part of the IE.

---++++INSPIRE Hydrography Data Model
The INSPIRE hydrography data model is an application schema conformant to ISO UML modelling rules to be used as part of INSPIRE. The model consists of three main sub models:
   * Hydro - Networks: to be used in GIS and modelling
   * Hydro - Physical Waters: to be used for mapping
   * Hydro - Reporting: to be used for reporting

As part of the model a number of hydro features are defined. The features are copied from the specification below.

The proposal is that the Surface Water IE (all use cases) will use the features defined in the D2.8.I.8 INSPIRE Data Specification on Hydrography &#8211; Guidelines (detailed above). This will allow a better cahnce of interoperability across the use cases. Nice aspects of  this model are:
   * The model has been based on existing standards from ISO and OGC.
   * The features are general enough not to upset anyone , but specific enough to be useful.
   * The feature set contains associated terrestrial and other features related to the surface water domain
Please comment on this page if you suggest a different model.
