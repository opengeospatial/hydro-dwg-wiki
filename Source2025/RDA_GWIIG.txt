---++ Overview

The Research Data Alliance (RDA) Global Water Information Interest Group (GWIIG) will serve as a platform leading to formation of RDA working group; as a venue for communication among RDA WGs and IGs focused on both technical eInfrastructure aspects (e.g. brokering; metadata and catalogs, dynamic data citation) and on related research domains (e.g. geosciences, agriculture, biodiversity); and as a coordination mechanism across a wide group of water information stakeholders, in particular those not previously involved in the OGC/WMO water standardization work.

This section of the HydroDWG twiki is dedicated to GWIIG activities. To encourage collaboration between OGC HydroDWG and RDA GWIIG and given the overlap in some topics, it was decided link website content as well.

As mentionned on the [[WebHome][homepage of the HydroDWG twiki]], the group is intended to be a public forum for communication, and both the <a href="https://lists.opengeospatial.org/mailman/listinfo/hydro.dwg" rel="nofollow" target="_top">email list</a> and this wiki are open to interested parties.
