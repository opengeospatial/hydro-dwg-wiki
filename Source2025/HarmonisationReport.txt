---++ Harmonising Standards for Water Observation Data - Discussion Paper

This report takes a look at exisiting standards for water data exchange and attempts to identify commonalties. A proposal to develop a harmonised, core model for observation data is discussed. It is proposed that this will allow for greater sharing and correct interpretation of data sets. 

The report is available on the OGC portal here: http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=35507&version=1

It is also attached for people who do not have access to the portal.
