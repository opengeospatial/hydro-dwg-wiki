---++ Results
   * Update on SOS server/clients (1-3 in agenda):
      * Simon J.: SOS server update was run recently for the DLZ-IT implementation; the web client is available in a consolidated version and a WMS is used as a background map; the test application is available at DLZ-IT.
      * Stefan F./Michael N.: SOS service (implementing O&M 1.0) is available on the TSM plattfrom; Kisters will come up with a test presentation for the TC meeting in Toulouse.
      * Stefan F. raised the questions of how to address the feature of interest (FOI) in the services; so far no common approach for getting data from the capabilities document using procedure, observed property and FOI is in practise; at this stage all SOS implementation are best practices (-> see discussion; was main part of the conference).
   * Discussion (arising from update): 
      * Content: How to get data into the SOS (encoding of procedure, observed property and FOI; problem of too big Capabilities documents)?
      * Agreed on:
        * Simon will distribute examples from the PEGELONLINE SOS (capa-bilities document and an O&M document providing waterlevel); they should be further discussed; Simon will contact Arne for further technical detail
        * Simon, Stefan and Michael (Sylvain? and Christian might join in) agreed on a telcon to that issue on the coming Tuesday; goal is to find a common approach how to get surface water into the SOS
   * Planning the Toulouse TC (Ulrich gave an update on the time line):
      * 21. September: Workshop on WaterML2.0 and IE (in depth discussion on surface water feature model, depending on interest &#189; or full day, organized by Peter Fitch)
      * 22. September: HDWG Meeting (presentation of results IEs, presenta-tions from 52°North and Kisters are planned, Christian and Carsten will give or prepare a used case 1 overview of results, Sylvain will re-port on SANDRE)
      * Participants from used case 1 in Toulouse; 52°North (Simon), Kisters (Stefan or Michael), SANDRE (Sylvain), Christian and Carsten will join over telcon
   * next phone conference is on Thursday, September 2nd at 12:00 (CEST), agenda: planning Toulouse
