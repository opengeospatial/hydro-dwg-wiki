It needs separate discussion. See image attached on the end. The most commonly used (and I think most correct) term is "hydraulic head" as a sum of "elevation head" and "pressure head" expressed in height unites. Groundwater table we can see in wells only. In aquifer this surface is invisible and very difficult to determine. Correct definition is: "surface where pressure in water is equal to pressure of atmospheric air – pressure head is equal zero. It is only one surface in underground and may have very complicated shape. It can run through many aquifers and aquitards in one aquifer system".

| | | Groundwater discharge is the removal of water from the saturated zone of a drainage basin across the watertable surface, together with the associated flow toward the water table in the saturated zone. In discharge areas the groundwater flow direction is upward and hydraulic head in the aquifer systems increases with depth. Two principal types of discharge can be differentiated and recognised in the field: point (focal) discharge (springs, seeps, streams and lakes) and diffuse discharge (evaporation from shallow water tables and biological discharge).

In case of aquifer or aquifer system it can be estimated on base of numerical model only and here are applied terms "potential yield" or "disposable yield".

      * %GRAY%Comment: I'm not convinced GroundwaterVolume is an administrative quantity. While the 3 volumes Boyan mentioned may be used for management purposes, surely they are properties of the real-world aquifer, and not human constructs. [BS]%ENDCOLOR%
      * %GRAY%Comment: But Groundwater Volume is not always coincident with an natural feature (aquifer or basin), it is also a legislated Permissible Consumptive Volume for an administrative area (e.g. Water Supply Protection Area, or Groundwater Management Area) that covers a partial area or volume of much larger aquifer, usually delineated to protect an asset such as a spring, or groundwater dependent lake, stream or ecosystem.

Management areas:

[RT, CS] Clarification that applies to all features listed below: There are two options for modeling “GW management areas”:

1)   GW Management Area used for protection of water and/or reporting and..?

Implications:
   1 
      1 The River Basin District entity cannot be covered inside this GW Man. Area feature - it is linked, but wider
      1 Natural conservation – protection area such as national parks, reservations etc. also cannot be covered inside this GW Man. Area feature. - it is linked but wider
   * Agree:
   * Disagree:
2)   GW Management Area as a type of a broader “Management Restriction Or Regulation Zone” entity

Implications:
   1 
      1 Then River Basin District, general Natural conservation-protection area, as well as GW management area (for protection of water and/or reporting) represent types of this generic feature (in INSPIRE we have created a code list with many possible types..)
   * Agree: CS, RT,
   * Disagree:
   * %GRAY%[FL] - scope the feature to a more generic gw management area.%ENDCOLOR%
   * %GRAY%[FL] - need to see while modeling if a relation can be set between gw management area and gw basin%ENDCOLOR%
   * %GRAY%[FL] --&gt; in scope, but need a more formal definition<br />%ENDCOLOR%

   * [[#ProtectedArea][Protected Area]]
      * [BB] delete; replace with one "(GW)ManagementArea"
      * %GRAY%Agree: BB, EB, BS, BW, PD, FL, HK, AK<br />%ENDCOLOR%
      * %GRAY%Disagree:%ENDCOLOR%
      * %GRAY%Comments: propose a general entity that represents different kinds of management areas. Issue is whether the scope should be limited to groundwater or extend to other area types (e.g. surface water management area). See details below. [BB]%ENDCOLOR%
      * %GRAY%Comments: see discussion paper 'Area management group definitions.docx' [RT]%ENDCOLOR%
      * %GRAY%Comments: possibly limit scope to groundwater only, but is this common practice? [BB]%ENDCOLOR%
      * %GRAY%Comments: "the point is that if we call it “GroundwaterManagementArea” it already limits the scope to only GW related management areas. Which is probably not correct since management areas (for restrictions, protection, reporting etc..) do not follow the natural “phenomenon” boundaries. Whereas if we call it generically like “ManagementArea” we can include all possible types of management areas (see the code list for different zone types included in the previous document). Also it is closer to the generic “river basin” management area concept which covers not only GW bodies but also surface bodies, drinking water protection zones etc.." [RT]%ENDCOLOR%
      * %GRAY%Comments: as per May meeting -- general consensus to use GW Management Area, limited to gw managaement, but with link to a more general Management Area entity in some other model [BB]%ENDCOLOR%

      * [BB] same as above. [BS]
      * Agree: RT, CS, HK
      * Disagree:
      * Comments: This generic class represents all types of area management-protection, restriction, regulation, reporting etc. entity. It means that this class can cover for instance River basin district, protection areas (including natural preservation types as well as groundwater management area used for protection and reporting which otherwise represent different entities. [RT]
   * [[#RiverBasinDistrict][River Basin District]]
      * [BB] same as above.
      * Agree: HK
      * Disagree: Out of Scope [BS]
      * Comments: Part of the surface hydrology domain rather than the groundwater domain [BS]
      * Comments: wider then GW Managment Area - see the clarification above [RT, CS]
   * [[#GroundwaterBasin][Groundwater Basin]]
      * [BB] same as above.
      * Agree: BS, RT, CS
      * Disagree:
      * Comments: limited to manaagement aspects. See comments above under Rock/Land Body for physical aspects.
      * Comment. This "Groundwater Basin" should not be confused with the Groundwater Basin above that refers to a collection of Aquifer Systems [BS]
