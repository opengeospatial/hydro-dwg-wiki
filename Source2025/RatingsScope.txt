   1 *Conversion tables (from and to, rather than stage-discharge)*
      1 rgs-1
      1 Handling vocabs as a meta issue
   1 *Multi-input variables (stage, index velocity -&gt; discharge, cross sectional area)*
      1 If not included then ensure current version is capable of extension
      1 How you define the function
      1 Information on how to use various conversions together to achieve an output -- the workflow or processing information. Chained conversion/transformation. Transfer function.
      1 Calibration information for development of the function.
      1 rgs-2
   1 *Which gaugings were used for which ratings*
      1 Which werenÂ’t used and why.
      1 Critical piece for uncertainty analysis.
      1 At least need Â“relevantÂ” gaugings to the rating curve.
      1 rgs-3
   1 *Segments*
      1 There is a need for modification of meta-elements of the rating model on a piecewise basis.
      1 Could be modeled as a way of handling changing metadata across a rating
      1 rgs-4
      1 rgs-20
      1 rgs-21
   1 *Loop ratings; backwater flow*
      1 Relate the rating to rising limb, steady state, falling limb
      1 Tidal influence
      1 Difficult and not useful?
      1 Technology (i.e. index velocity) has overtaken the issue..

      1 rgs-8
   1 *Equations*

         1 rgs-6
         1 rgs-7
      1 Reverse lookup equations
         1 Just a query for the opposite direction conversion?
         1 Reverse lookup of point tables was noted to be statistically invalid, however it is very common practice.
         1 Suggestion that an equation could also optionally include the inverse equation.
         1 Up to the data provider whether it is exposed
         1 rgs-9
   1 *Different family of tables for different purposes*
      1 Archive / Operational
      1 Supported through collections
   1 *What is the primary key?*
      1 Site / Point / ParameterFrom / ParameterTo
      1 rgs-10
   1 *Datum*
      1 Time series in different datum to rating?
      1 Majority of cases will be in local datum; rarer to be in a national/ordnance datum
      1 rgs-11
   1 *Method of curve development*
      1 Simple type (code) for the method use
      1 Reference to more detailed
   1 *Versions, curve history and shifts DB1 vs DB2 -&gt; hug!*
      1 Change date for changes against a rating
      1 Versions can be supplied in a document, but would not be referenced by a period of application.
      1 USGS techniques in handling ratings. Corrections to raw stage data.
      1 rgs-12
   1 *Period of application*
      1 Transitions (phase) change
         1 rgs-13
         1 Method or process for smoothing - common or org. based method vocabulary
      1 Start and end dates. Make the end date optional for specifying null periods -- need a null reason. Overlap should be checked for?
      1 rgs-14
      1 rgs-15
      1 The use of end dates may be an ongoing discussion !
   1 *Quality codes*
      1 general and profiled vocabularies are required
      1 Quality codes per input/x range and per table point
      1 rgs-16
   1 *Limits*
      1 y range for specifying validated range (within rating), extrapolated range, beyond extrapolation
      1 In scope
      1 rgs-20
   1 *Point interpolation*
      1 Resolution will be determined by the data provider
      1 Expanded rating tables should be acceptable to the community
      1 rgs-5
      1 rgs-21
   1 *Cross sections*
      1 Details of the control feature
      1 Photographs of control, site photo
      1 Significant levels (e.g. flood warning levels) zero flow, bank full,
         1 rgs-5
         1 rgs-21
      1 ArcHydro has a model that may be useful
   1 *Responsible parties*
   1 *Approval level*
      1 Lifecycle of development
      1 Locked down curve once it’s been used
      1 Approved before data can be archived
      1 Review cycle, dates of review, random reviews, reviewed on trigger (e.g. legal)
      1 Need a vocabulary
      1 Agree in scope
      1 rgs-22
   1 *Engineered structures*
      1 Gates
      1 Dynamic (gates etc) vs. static structures
      1 Pipe ratings (urban water)
      1 3D ratings may be out of scope
      1 State of the engineered structure (gate position, angle)
      1 Beaver dams
      1 Very specific for particular circumstances -- the need for an interoperable format would be minimal
      1 rgs-23
   1 *What is the difference between data transfer and methods of applying the data. process / work flow.*
      1 Does this require a high level statement of delineation between data and data functions(use)
      1 Chaining, process workflows is likely out of scope
      1 Link to the product/system/method used to develop the rating
      1 rgs-24
   1 *Uncertainty*
      1 Can an input range be used to communicate various aspects of uncertainty information?
      1 Providing robust link to the used gaugings with associated metadata <i>should </i>be enough
      1 Allow extension points, potential to use UncertML and determine if would suit
      1 Confidence levels for points in rating?
      1 Gauging deviations
         1 Kisters has some examples
      1 rgs-25
   1 *Provenance*
      1 Communication of sufficient information to enable the user to manage provenance if they choose to.
      1 Adherence to standards to ensure credibility of the data. Potentially a filter or query?
         1 ISO19115 conformance tests
      1 Hooks to allow sufficient provenance to be inserted. Probably (ideally) by reference.
