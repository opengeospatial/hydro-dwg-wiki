---+ Gaugings scope

   1 *Gaugings by themselves or in relation to ratings?*
      1 A block of all RatingObservations with reference to rating
      1 A rating contains relevant RatingObservations
      1 Inline or external block
   1 *RatingObservations status*
      1 Included in rating deveopment
      1 Excluded from rating development
      1 rgs-27
   1 *Specific attributes/metadata, e.g.*
      1 Control conditions, weed growth, ice, etc.
         1 rgs-29
      1 Flow, Sediment, Quality, Ecological types as meta types?
         1 rgs-31
   1 *Use of instance for identifying specific sensors/devices from a measuring point/location*
   1 *Definition of rating observations that are relevant to a rating*
      1 RatingObservations that occur in the rating period of application?
      1 Out of period RatingObservations that are used?
      1 rgs-27
   1 *Generically an x-y result?*
      1 rgs-33
   1 *Is the method of creating the gauging in scope? Details of the observations taken to determine the result?*
      1 rgs-29
   1 *On site measurement (site visit)*
      1 rgs-28
   1 *Handle simulated gaugings (from a model)?*
      1 Yes, procedure would describe the method of creation.
      1 rgs-29
   1 *Synchronisation. E.g. where gauging takes an hour, is it being synced with the stage. Begin and end gauge height.*
      1 Gauging start and end time
      1 Gauging application time
      1 rgs-29
   1 *Name*
      1 <span class="WYSIWYG_COLOR" style="color: slategray;">RatingPairs</span>
      1 __RatingObservations__
      1 <span class="WYSIWYG_COLOR" style="color: slategray;">GaugeObservations</span>
      1 <span class="WYSIWYG_COLOR" style="color: slategray;">ControlObservation</span>
      1 <span class="WYSIWYG_COLOR" style="color: slategray;">Gauging</span>
   1 *Observers assessment of RatingObservation quality or usability - text description.*
   1 *Quality*
      1 Very subjective -- egos get in the way! (Staff completing gaugings assessing their work as good)
      1 Adherence to organisational standards
      1 Good measurement of bad conditions?
      1 Nominal range of uncertainty (0-5, 5-10, 10-15%) & a quality category
      1 Need to be able to handle future methods for tracking uncertainty (e.g. ADCP estimation)
   1 *Core required types*
      1 Stream state, rising, falling, steady
      1 Begin, end date, Discharge date (applied time)
      1 Used outside its period of applicablity
      1 Control conditions (clear, blocked, backwater affected etc.), conditions that are different from
         1 Could be booleans, yes/no
      1 Information that assists in deciding if the rating observation should be used in rating
      1 Gauge height change during gauging
      1 Aggregation method
         1 Weighting discharge against the stage change period
      1 Measurement procedure used
         1 Volumetric
         1 A-V, ADCP
         1 Mechanical meter
         1 Tracer
         1 Beer bottle
      1 How to ensure we know what gaugings are being ????
