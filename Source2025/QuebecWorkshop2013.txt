---+++ Location

GSC/INRS Quebec office location: <br /><img alt="plan_quebec_2009_upd.png" height="465" src="https://www.seegrid.csiro.au/wiki/pub/CGIModel/QuebecF2F2009/plan_quebec_2009_upd.png" width="638" />

The meeting will be held in [[http://www.inrs.ca/english/homepage][INRS]] (Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique) building which host GSC-Quebec offices. GSC-Québec is located at <a href="http://maps.google.ca/maps?f=q&hl=fr&geocode=&q=490+de+la+couronne,quebec&sll=46.812754,-71.215223&sspn=0.510335,0.884399&g=quebec&ie=UTF8&ll=46.813094,-71.224355&spn=0.003987,0.010986&z=17" target="_top">490 de la Couronne, in downtown Quebec City</a>.
---+++ Accessing the building
   * The Workshop will start at 10:00 on Monday 17th, other days at 08:00 or 09:00 (see agenda).
   * A badge will be waiting for you at the front desk.
   * Front desk opens at 08:00
   * You will need to sign in and out and return your badge at the end of each day.
---+++ Communications

We will have wifi connection in workshop rooms (#2417 and #2422 on second floor) and teleconference equipment.

---+++ Getting to Quebec City

Quebec City (YQB) <a href="http://www.aeroportdequebec.com/" target="_top">Jean Lesage International airport</a> is relatively small therefore, direct international flights often goes through Montréal, QC (YUL), Toronto ON (YYZ) or Newark (EWR, NJ,USA) and other surrounding hubs and then you get a short leg to Quebec City. You might want to consider going to Montréal and then use a shuttle to Quebec City (2h30 trip) for about 110 C$ (roundtrip). The service is offered 5 times a day by <a href="http://www.orleansexpress.com/corpo/service_aeroportuaire.aspx" target="_top">Orléans Express</a> from Montréal Pierre-Elliot-Trudeau International Airport to Quebec City downtown, just a few blocks from GSC office.

You might want to rent a car in Montréal and drive to Quebec City. The only problem is getting through Montréal traffic if you are unlucky enough to arrive during rush hour. The airport is at the west end on Montréal Island, and you must cross the whole city to head east.

There are 2 major highways to get to Quebec City

Autoroute 40, on the north shore of the St-Lawrence River.

When entering Quebec City, A40 will become A440 (Autoroute Charest). Just to confuse the issue, A40 does continue, but on a segment north of the city. Just follow A440 Est (East). The road will narrow gradually to become Boulevard Charest which will lead you downtown, just to the doorstep of one of the hotels.

Autoroute 20, on the south shore of the St-Lawrence River. This means you must cross either a bridge or a tunnel to get on the south shore and then go east to Quebec. You will arrive to Quebec by crossing the Pierre Laporte bridge through A73 Nord to cross the river back to the north shore. A few kilometres after the bridge, at the foot of a long hill, you can connect on A440 Est (Autoroute Charest). Just follow A440 Est (East). The road will narrow gradually to become Boulevard Charest which will lead you downtown, just to the doorstep of one of the hotels.

None of these are very scenic, just bland strips of asphalt. If you have some time, you could try <a href="http://www.lecheminduroy.com/en/index.php" target="_top">Chemin du Roy</a> (King’s road), on the north shore which follows the first road built during the french regime . It goes through a series small charming villages along the St-Lawrence river.

---+++ Accommodation

There are many hotels within walking distance of the office and Quebec is relatively affordable.

Hotel Pur (<a href="http://www.hotelpur.com/" target="_top">http://www.hotelpur.com</a>). “Seductively stylish and sleek", as they advertise. Rooms are black and white with minimalist design.

Best Western, just across the street (<a href="http://www.hotelquebec.com/" target="_top">http://www.hotelquebec.com/</a>)

Royal William (<a href="http://www.royalwilliam.com/" target="_top">http://www.royalwilliam.com/</a>) There is hardly a closer place to the office. 1 block away.

Royal Palace (<a href="http://www.hotelsjaro.com/index-en.aspx" target="_top">http://www.hotelsjaro.com/index-en.aspx</a>) Bit further, but still walking distance (you must go up and down the hill)
