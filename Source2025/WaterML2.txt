!WaterML 2.0 Part 1 - Time Series has been adopted as an international standard in the Open Geospatial Consortium as of June 2012, see <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/waterml" target="_blank">http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/waterml</a>

In bringing this subsequently to the World Meteorological Organization for co-adoption, the WMO suggested the time series description and usage was more general than just for water, and requested that !WaterML 2.0 Part 1 be the basis for a !TimeseriesML standard, which could be used by multiple domains such as hydro, atmospheric, ocean and climate. This is now underway in the Timeseries SWG, see <a href="https://portal.opengeospatial.org/?m=projects&a=view&project_id=470" target="_blank">OGC portal</a> for more information (member login required; if you're an OGC member but don't have access, you may need to become an Observer on this SWG, which you can do <a href="https://portal.opengeospatial.org/?m=public&orderby=default&tab=6" target="_blank">here</a>).
