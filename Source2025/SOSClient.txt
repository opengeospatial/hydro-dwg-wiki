---+SOS Client Discussions


---++ CSIRO client 
An example of the CSIRO SOS client app can be seen here: http://www.csiro.au/sensorweb/au.csiro.OgcThinClient/OgcThinClient.html. This uses GWT and direct parsing of the service responses (currently encoded in plan Observations and Measurements). 

---++ 52North client 
There is a 52North thin client (http://52north.org/maven/project-sites/swe/clients/Thin_SWE_Client/index.html) and a thick client (http://52north.org/maven/project-sites/swe/clients/Rich_OX_Client/index.html)

The thin client just supports plotting functions (no maps). Thick client should be able to connect to WMS as well, but don't think it supports WFS.
