*Overseas visitors will need to complete this [[http://www.osec.doc.gov/osy/NOAA/Forms/foreign%20visitor%20form.pdf][form]] by 1 June 2017 in order to be able to attend the workshop at NWC, NOAA. Please submit your completed form to Dave Blodgett (dblodgett@usgs.gov) by this date.*

The [[http://water.noaa.gov/about/nwc][National Water Center]], Office of Water Prediction, NOAA is in Tuscaloosa Alabama on the University of Alabama campus.

You should plan to fly into [[https://www.google.com/maps/dir/birmingham+airport/Tuscaloosa/@33.3603204,-87.7199467,9z/am=t/data=!3m1!4b1!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x88891aa4f6775025:0x9326a00858ed2b68!2m2!1d-86.754126!2d33.5624269!1m5!1m1!1s0x8888af2e91c24067:0xacabfbfd16892b58!2m2!1d-87.5691735!2d33.2098407][Birmingham and rent a car or share a ride to Tuscaloosa]]. The drive is very easy, about 1 hour, but there are few options other than driving.

Flying into [[https://www.google.com/maps/dir/atlanta+airport/Tuscaloosa/@33.0842016,-88.2192776,7z/am=t/data=!3m1!4b1!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x88f4fd2fe1035901:0x4117a3ef1892b048!2m2!1d-84.4277001!2d33.6407282!1m5!1m1!1s0x8888af2e91c24067:0xacabfbfd16892b58!2m2!1d-87.5691735!2d33.2098407][Atlanta and driving to Tuscaloosa]] is also an option (3 hr drive) that could avoid domestic flight complications since Atlanta is a major international hub.

---++++ Accommodation

We were unable to get a block of rooms at the [[https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hotel+Capstone/@33.206416,-87.5426237,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x8886029de1d58553:0x3b4f4a0e9325004f!8m2!3d33.206416!4d-87.540435][Capstone]] which is the closest [[https://www.google.com/maps/dir/33.2070154,-87.5406588/33.2171216,-87.5414604/@33.2122716,-87.5461923,16z/am=t/data=!3m1!4b1!4m9!4m8!1m5!3m4!1m2!1d-87.5430444!2d33.2086183!3s0x8886029ee63f809d:0xbc85c57972bd993!1m0!3e2][(about a 20 minute walk)]].  There may be rooms available individually there, but food options are limited nearby Capstone.

I would recommend a hotel downtown.

There is an [[https://www.google.com/maps/place/Embassy+Suites+by+Hilton+Tuscaloosa+Alabama+Downtown/@33.2132032,-87.5803377,15z/data=!4m15!1m9!2m8!1sHotels!3m6!1sHotels!2sHotel+Indigo+Tuscaloosa+Downtown,+111+Greensboro+Ave,+Tuscaloosa,+AL+35401!3s0x888602dd722708c3:0x320a03ce13e21e6a!4m2!1d-87.571599!2d33.2131811!3m4!1s0x0:0xba0fd190d220920c!8m2!3d33.2102031!4d-87.5692105][Embassy Suites]] and a [[https://www.google.com/maps/place/Home2+Suites+by+Hilton+Tuscaloosa+Downtown+University+Boulevard/@33.2132032,-87.5803377,15z/data=!4m15!1m9!2m8!1sHotels!3m6!1sHotels!2sHotel+Indigo+Tuscaloosa+Downtown,+111+Greensboro+Ave,+Tuscaloosa,+AL+35401!3s0x888602dd722708c3:0x320a03ce13e21e6a!4m2!1d-87.571599!2d33.2131811!3m4!1s0x0:0xc2deb0d9336aa28b!8m2!3d33.2090317!4d-87.5719491][Home2 Suites]] nearby as well.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuscaloosa,_Alabama][Tuscaloosa]] has some history going back to the early 1800s and is a very pleasant place to spend time. It is also on the [[https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/uv?site_no=02465005][Black Warrior River]], [[https://cida.usgs.gov/nwc/#!waterbudget/achuc/031601130201][Water Budget Summary here]].
