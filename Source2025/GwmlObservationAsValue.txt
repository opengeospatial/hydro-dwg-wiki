---+ OM_Observation used as property values

There are a couple of things that needs to be set in the way we encode OM_Observation, specially when we use them as property values.

There are two cases when we use OM_Observation as values
   1 <span style="background-color: transparent;">When using relatedObservation on any sub types of SF_SamplingFeature </span>
   1 <span style="background-color: transparent;"> Using a specific property (such as GW_FluidBody/gwBodyVolume) </span>
OM_Observation has a mandatory featureOfInterest that is supposed to point back to the feature that is the “bearer of the property”. <span style="background-color: transparent;">In case 2) , the bearer of the property is obviously the feature having this property, so technically, we should constrain featureOfInterest to link back to that feature</span>

Eg: we should technically have this

 <img alt="obs_as_value.png" height="190" src="%ATTACHURL%/obs_as_value.png" title="obs_as_value.png" width="449" />

Issues: (Question in red)
---++ Cases where the bearer of property is not a feature

(GW_WaterBudget for instance, is a Type, not a Feature), so we can’t use featureOfInterest to link it back

%RED%In this case, we should point back to the refers to this Type ? In case of WaterBudget, who does ?%ENDCOLOR%
---++ Same Observation shared by multiple properties

nothing prevents more than one property to point to the same Observation (by reference), which becomes a problem for the featureOfInterest (foi is 1..1). It can be done schematically even if does not make sense logically. <span style="background-color: transparent;">%RED%Should we have a clause that says%ENDCOLOR% “<span>OM_Observation that are values of explicit properties will use featureOfInterest to identify the legitimate bearer of properties.  Reference to OM_Observation from an explicit property when the property bearer is not the owner is invalid</span>” (s%RED%hould it be invalid ?, or can it have another meaning%ENDCOLOR%)</span>
---++ ObservedProperty

OM_Observation also has an observedProperty. Technically, this should be a reference to the property (the property type, not a specific instance of the property) this observation is about. We have several options (%RED%which one should we use%ENDCOLOR%)
   1 Use a reference to schemas - like this "http://ngwd-bdnes.cits.nrcan.gc.ca/service/gwml/schemas/2.1/gwml2-well.xsd#GW_WellType.gwWellConstructedDepth (there are no good way to link to a property, it has no identity - (apparently, new ISO 19109 will change this)
   1 Use a good old vocabulary unrelated to domain schema - with the benefit of having more precise definition of the phenomena than the schema provide
