---++ Notes on the GE IE discussion
   * *WaterML 2*

   * *Timelines*
      * June 14 deadline (OGC TC meeting) for !WaterML2 beta
      * To be available to GW IE ~4 weeks before 

   * *Timeseries*
      * Need instruction from P.Tayor on how to vary precision of date/time datatype in result (e.g. just day, month, other range, etc.)
      * Agreed to remove 'Anyscalar' datatype as result of timeseries observation, and create subclasses for different scalar types

   * *Sampling/sampled feature*
      * Issue: cannot uniquely link an observation to a particular sampled feature, because the intermediary sampling feature can be linked to multiple sampled features---tbd by the design group
      * Encoding of the feature: should it be by reference or in line?
         * tentative decision: do both within IE as part of the experiment.  Inline (current) for June and both for December. URIs for the link to be a WFS call.
      * !WaterML 2 featureOfInterest will be a !samplingFeature
      * Should depth features such as water well screens be !samplingFeature?
      * We might need to add a singled value time series.
      * Need to add accuracy code to result data structure
      * If we are to stand up a catalog, we need WaterML2 to be able to express the kind of result types

   * *Other*
   * Services
      * What all needs to be in place?

   * getCapabilities? 
      * Need to make a change request.  Pete Taylor will look at and distribute.

   * describeSensor?
      * boyan and eric will draw up conceptual model of sensor, sampling feature, sampled feature, method (procedure)

   * specimen and filters
      * issues with sos re: specimen model of O&M

   * R&D: Look at describeObservation.

   * Clients
      * Focussed testing from June to December.
      * Need to come up with client test (edge) cases. (Nate)
