---+ Ratings Use Cases

Core use cases:
   1 *Data scrutiny*
      1 Uncertainty research
      1 Geomorphic process, cross sections
      1 Engineer for design purpose (e.g. designing a flood barrier)
      1 Analysis and assessment of input data streams for hydrologic modeling
   1 *Retrieve specific curve (using the most up to date curve, or a specific version)*
      1 Time sensitive (floods, events)
      1 Inundation modeling (reversing out the stage)
      1 Emergency services
      1 A site visit or comparing a gauging point against the curve
   1 *Full rating history*
      1 Exchange purposes, to run a transform at any time
      1 Only includes the active ratings, does not include each development rating version and shift detail.
   1 *Suspended sediment and load calculations*
   1 *Transfer between schemas (loss level):*
      1 Similar schema to similar schema
      1 Existing schema to OGC schema
      1 Schema to flat file
   1 *Research services*
      1 Point a student towards a service with stage, rating, and associated gaugings.
