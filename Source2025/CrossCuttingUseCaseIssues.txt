---+ *Use-case cross-cutting issues*

-- Main.BoyanBrodaric - 27 Nov 2012

I see mutual interaction (but not replacement) in the water volume and water quality "reporting" from use cases 2 (policy) and use case 3 (environmental) with use case 1 (commercial), because the commercial use case is also the "simplified" public point of information (eg for citizens), isn't it?
