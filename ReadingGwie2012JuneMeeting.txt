RT: INSPIRE aims at being consistent with International standard.

Consensus to work together.

DB : Authoritative model

JJS : INSPIRE must sure they can implement it.

BB: we still have conceptual differences.

Goal for today: come to a plan to address those issues

After lunch: concrete step to decide what to do.

Strategies : define use cases and discuss conceptual differences.

Main UC: share GW data between agency. INSPIRE is basic infrastructure to be extended to specific use (core entities), GWML is more scientific (geology)

BW: Important UC is propagating data to public.

DB: Need central model for federating.

RT,BB: Difference between clients (user, statistician, science, policies)

BB: Group of people need more detailed, while other need details. Must determine

BB: what is the scope, data exchange, data delivery and reporting (summary).

RA: What is the governance ? WMO ?

RA: What aspect is naming (and having convention about identifying things)

PS demands clarification about "reporting".

BB For some UC, only a small set is of interest. Example : national reporting -&gt; aquifer summary: recharge, dischage only. Fewer features in reporting scenarii

Looking at BW ppt.

TN: INSPIRE was connection between Geology and Hydrology. Suggests that we bring in more experts (IAH).

BB,DB: Themes
   * %BLUE% *Rock system* %ENDCOLOR%
   * %BLUE% *Groundwater System (water dynamic, flows, etc.)* %ENDCOLOR%
   * %BLUE% *Wells and abstraction artefacts* %ENDCOLOR%
   * %BLUE% *Related Observations* %ENDCOLOR%
   * %BLUE% *Water budget (Recharge and Discharge)Reservoirs* %ENDCOLOR%
      * Total water budget and subsurface flows (inter aquifers)
   * 
   * %BLUE% *Water Body (quality, volume of material). Piezometric surface is a property of Water Body* %ENDCOLOR%
   * %BLUE% *Water management units* %ENDCOLOR%
BB: For strictly environmental reason, Water Budget, Economic reasons : Reservoir

BW: Water budget fits to hydrologic model in INSPIRE.

TN: Connect GW and Surface water to prepare a budget.

BB: two aspect - flow from surface to subsurface. What about one aquifer to another ? Where is this handled in INSPIRE ?

BB: Next question . Do we want to include everything ?

SC: Whatever you do, modularize alongs those scopes.

PS: What about reporting unit (non physical limits)

BB: Do we model all of modularise. Figure out what are the main packaging.

DB: Water budget not in a HG specific.

RA : WaterML profile ?

BB: Priority on wich one are core. Discuss now or later.

PS: relates to use case.

DB : defer, defer

RA: Capture the use cases to drive the modules.

BB: next step is to define use cases.

---++ Conceptual issues

%BLUE% *Open issue about GeologicUnit* %ENDCOLOR%

Different organisation for AquiferSystem, but semantically the same

Some conceptual differences for GroundwaterBody between HY_Feature and GWML

Wells are O&M support of observation for GWML while INSPIRE have a link to INSPIRE monitoring model.

%BLUE% *INSPIRE division along active and inactive make lots of sense because of the impact on gw flow.* %ENDCOLOR%

Well in HY_Feature is more closely related to INSPIRE concept of a well.

JM: Lots of properties from GeologicUnit are not necessary for HydroGeologicUnit and did not want to bring all this extra properties

BB: lots of GeologicUnit are not mandatory

JL: INSPIRE version of GeologicUnit is much simplified

BB: Need a deeper discussion of address this issue.

TN: Longer discussion needed but Skype is bad.

DB: support for borehole is a big requirement. overlap between hydrogeology and geology is very close in borehole context.

RT: different understanding of GeoSciML.

SC: GeoSciML requires a lot of rationalisation, even from geologists.

RT: maybe clarify the definition of what is a GeologicUnit

JL: The issue of excessive properties in GeoSciML is not as pressing in INSPIRE since the model is simplified.
---++ Next steps

General agreement to proceed under OGC, we need to draf a document (a proposal to do this work under OGC under the Experiment venue with the goal to come to a specification).

People interested to bring all those aspect under a single model under OGC.

RT: yes. INSPIRE should be based on global standard and not create a "competing" model. Organisally wide ,JRC involment will be clarified

BW: same, good oppotunity to bring.

EB: obvious need for transborder

PS: interested as an observer.

SC: supportive. Since GeoSciML and this initiative will be under OGC. Will look at package

DB: on board. need as common as possible with Canada, and within states. Mission critical for full monitoring network

JJS: yes, BRGM is interest, would involve Hydrogeologist.

BGS: keen in INSPIRE conformance. like to have hydrogeologist involved

ID: WMO support. willing to provide sampled feature and linkage to surface water.

BB: need to do this for mission critical context.

TN: Best solution to connect to global standard. fully agree

JM: Yes, of course. Hope to participate to global. But university not part of OGC, work done under Polish Association for Spatial Information.

Can this work can be carried by non-OGC members.

SC: OGC membership is 500$. Local government 200$

TN: speak with IAH to seek interest.
