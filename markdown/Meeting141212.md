# Meeting notes

## Model overview

\- Upper/lower limits. May crossover with the range values?

\- Define specifc range values. Create a tighter connection between the range values and the coversions. Two ways: an explicit relationship to conversion and the ability to transfer separately.

\- Units of measure for the parameters; should they be represented within the conversion class? currently down in the IV/DV table tuple.

\- Capturing the description of parameters. Need to be consistent with part 1. May use the same local dictionary for params?

\- Transition period. Put Paul's \<a href="<a href="RatingPhasedDuration" class="wikilink">RatingPhasedDuration</a>" target="\_blank"\>document \</a\>\<a href="<a href="RatingPhasedDuration" class="wikilink">RatingPhasedDuration</a>" target="\_blank"\>up on wiki\</a\>. Model the approach both ways. Email on preferences.

\- Range values: water quality thresholds, other approaches -- more complex thresholds. May have an algorithm for the values of the range type. Work on list of common types.

\- What does the MP actually represent? E.g. mutliple flow series at locations close

\- Do we need reason for inclusion/exclusion of gaugings? Could be a second pass on this. GW: could be an extension class from a general process class.

\- Show example of usage. How does it relate to the phenomenon types?

\- 3d ratings out of scope for first pass; may daisy chain.

\- UML model setup to list and wiki.

## Next steps

\- Presenation to Redlands TC at the <a href="HydroDWG" class="wikilink">HydroDWG</a> session on the 16th Jan: <http://www.opengeospatial.org/event/1301tcagenda>. We will forward around the draft presentation.
