In New Zealand the regional councils are responsible for approving consents to drill and abstract a defined volume of groundwater per time period (eg arbitray example: 3 m^3 per day). Therefore they need to know about the "quantitive status" of the aquifer. I think this "requirement" can be fulfilled, too. Regarding quantitative (or physical) reporting, indeed we need to figure out in more detail, how. There is a lot of derived and processed information, not much real raw (observation) data is involved anymore, I'd say.
