# Ratings Use Cases

Core use cases:

1.  **Data scrutiny**
    1.  Uncertainty research
    2.  Geomorphic process, cross sections
    3.  Engineer for design purpose (e.g. designing a flood barrier)
    4.  Analysis and assessment of input data streams for hydrologic modeling
2.  **Retrieve specific curve (using the most up to date curve, or a specific version)**
    1.  Time sensitive (floods, events)
    2.  Inundation modeling (reversing out the stage)
    3.  Emergency services
    4.  A site visit or comparing a gauging point against the curve
3.  **Full rating history**
    1.  Exchange purposes, to run a transform at any time
    2.  Only includes the active ratings, does not include each development rating version and shift detail.
4.  **Suspended sediment and load calculations**
5.  **Transfer between schemas (loss level):**
    1.  Similar schema to similar schema
    2.  Existing schema to OGC schema
    3.  Schema to flat file
6.  **Research services**
    1.  Point a student towards a service with stage, rating, and associated gaugings.
