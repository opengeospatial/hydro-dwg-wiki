# Relationship to relevant (feature) models

## <a href="HY_Features" class="wikilink">HY_Features</a>

<a href="HY_Features" class="wikilink">HY_Features</a> model has some logical connection points through the related features in the <a href="HY_SurfaceWaterBody" class="wikilink">HY_SurfaceWaterBody</a> package: E.g. <a href="HY_River" class="wikilink">HY_River</a>, Reach etc. There is also a <a href="HY_CrossSection" class="wikilink">HY_CrossSection</a> which provides some geometric properties (area) and the reach geometry:

If sections are included in the scope it would be possible to relate some relevant features here.

## INSPIRE

INSPIRE is similarly focussed on the network structure and topology, but does identify core featuers that are relevant. E.g. water courses, physical features and man-made features (embankments, fords, dams etc.). All these types of objects are able to carry geometries but specifics are not defined.
