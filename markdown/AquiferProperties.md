# Aquifer Properties - Feature Description

**Definition**: A measured or calculated physical or hydraulic property of an aquifer such as hydraulic conductivity, Transmissivity, Storativity, porosity, effective porosity, Specific Yield (drainable porosity) and Retention (non-drainable porosity), Specific Capacity (it is well parameter), etc. usually measured at a well or series of wells (based on \<a href="<http://pubs.usgs.gov/wsp/wsp2220/>" rel="nofollow" title="Heath 1983"\>Heath 1983\</a\>, Freeze & Cherry 1979, Fetter 2001) (it can be also measured in laboratory on base of aquifer samples)

**Properties**:

- Transmissivity (t)
- Hydraulic Conductivity (K)
- Storage Coefficient (S)
- Specific Storage Coefficient (Ss)
- Porosity (n)
- Effective Porosity
- Retention
- Storativity
- Specific Yield
