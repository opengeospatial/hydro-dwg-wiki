## Dates and Location

20-22 June 2012\<br /\>The University of Reading\<br /\>The Conference is no. 176 which is on the first floor of the Harry Pitt Building. \<br /\>School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences Harry Pitt Building, 3 Earley Gate\<br /\>Campus details are attached at the \<a href="<http://external.opengis.org/twiki_public/HydrologyDWG/ReadingWorkshop2012>" title="HDWM workshop page"\>HDWG workshop page\</a\>

## Internet connection

The venue has wireless internet connectivity available for participants via eduroam. Visitors from outside the university can use Eduroam if their institution is part of the Eduroam Federation (<http://www.eduroam.org/>).\<br /\>If you do not have an eduroam account then there is no wireless network access available. We are organising to have a few LAN connections available during the RGS workshop. Hope fully the LAN connection can be shared either through a wired or wireless hub, we are awaiting detail on this. I suggest RGS participants bring a LAN patch cable (4-6m) just incase wireless sharing is not permitted.
