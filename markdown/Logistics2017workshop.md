**Overseas visitors will need to complete this [form](http://www.osec.doc.gov/osy/NOAA/Forms/foreign%20visitor%20form.pdf) by 1 June 2017 in order to be able to attend the workshop at NWC, NOAA. Please submit your completed form to Dave Blodgett (<dblodgett@usgs.gov>) by this date.**

The [National Water Center](http://water.noaa.gov/about/nwc), Office of Water Prediction, NOAA is in Tuscaloosa Alabama on the University of Alabama campus.

You should plan to fly into [Birmingham and rent a car or share a ride to Tuscaloosa](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/birmingham+airport/Tuscaloosa/@33.3603204,-87.7199467,9z/am=t/data=!3m1!4b1!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x88891aa4f6775025:0x9326a00858ed2b68!2m2!1d-86.754126!2d33.5624269!1m5!1m1!1s0x8888af2e91c24067:0xacabfbfd16892b58!2m2!1d-87.5691735!2d33.2098407). The drive is very easy, about 1 hour, but there are few options other than driving.

Flying into [Atlanta and driving to Tuscaloosa](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/atlanta+airport/Tuscaloosa/@33.0842016,-88.2192776,7z/am=t/data=!3m1!4b1!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x88f4fd2fe1035901:0x4117a3ef1892b048!2m2!1d-84.4277001!2d33.6407282!1m5!1m1!1s0x8888af2e91c24067:0xacabfbfd16892b58!2m2!1d-87.5691735!2d33.2098407) is also an option (3 hr drive) that could avoid domestic flight complications since Atlanta is a major international hub.

#### Accommodation

We were unable to get a block of rooms at the [Capstone](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hotel+Capstone/@33.206416,-87.5426237,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x8886029de1d58553:0x3b4f4a0e9325004f!8m2!3d33.206416!4d-87.540435) which is the closest [(about a 20 minute walk)](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/33.2070154,-87.5406588/33.2171216,-87.5414604/@33.2122716,-87.5461923,16z/am=t/data=!3m1!4b1!4m9!4m8!1m5!3m4!1m2!1d-87.5430444!2d33.2086183!3s0x8886029ee63f809d:0xbc85c57972bd993!1m0!3e2). There may be rooms available individually there, but food options are limited nearby Capstone.

I would recommend a hotel downtown. The [Hotel Indigo](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hotel+Indigo+Tuscaloosa+Downtown/@33.2131811,-87.5737877,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x888602dd722708c3:0x320a03ce13e21e6a!8m2!3d33.2131811!4d-87.571599) is a very pleasant [2 mile walk to the National Water Center.](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Hotel+Indigo+Tuscaloosa+Downtown,+111+Greensboro+Ave,+Tuscaloosa,+AL+35401,+USA/National+Water+Center,+3rd+Place,+Tuscaloosa,+AL,+United+States/@33.2169828,-87.5742919,14z/am=t/data=!3m1!4b1!4m24!4m23!1m15!1m1!1s0x888602dd722708c3:0x320a03ce13e21e6a!2m2!1d-87.571599!2d33.2131811!3m4!1m2!1d-87.566242!2d33.2151389!3s0x888602c2c5d6d239:0xaf3dc41f58d3cf62!3m4!1m2!1d-87.5513929!2d33.218946!3s0x888602bba1d65481:0x6be8a698dca2ba60!1m5!1m1!1s0x888602a0cd9f71cf:0xeda336d12bd244b9!2m2!1d-87.5414038!2d33.2175678!3e2) And if we share rides to/from the airport, those who would like to drive to the NWC can coordinate. There is an [Embassy Suites](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Embassy+Suites+by+Hilton+Tuscaloosa+Alabama+Downtown/@33.2132032,-87.5803377,15z/data=!4m15!1m9!2m8!1sHotels!3m6!1sHotels!2sHotel+Indigo+Tuscaloosa+Downtown,+111+Greensboro+Ave,+Tuscaloosa,+AL+35401!3s0x888602dd722708c3:0x320a03ce13e21e6a!4m2!1d-87.571599!2d33.2131811!3m4!1s0x0:0xba0fd190d220920c!8m2!3d33.2102031!4d-87.5692105) and a [Home2 Suites](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Home2+Suites+by+Hilton+Tuscaloosa+Downtown+University+Boulevard/@33.2132032,-87.5803377,15z/data=!4m15!1m9!2m8!1sHotels!3m6!1sHotels!2sHotel+Indigo+Tuscaloosa+Downtown,+111+Greensboro+Ave,+Tuscaloosa,+AL+35401!3s0x888602dd722708c3:0x320a03ce13e21e6a!4m2!1d-87.571599!2d33.2131811!3m4!1s0x0:0xc2deb0d9336aa28b!8m2!3d33.2090317!4d-87.5719491) nearby as well.

#### Location

To wet your appetite for the locale, we will be able to visit [301 Bistro](https://www.google.com/maps/place/301+Bistro,+Bar+&+Beer+Garden/@33.2112122,-87.5689856,16.68z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1sTuscaloosa+restaurants!3m4!1s0x0:0x7f4b10f65312a609!8m2!3d33.2115283!4d-87.5685695), the [Levee Bar and Grill](https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+Levee+Bar+&+Grill/@33.215789,-87.572987,3a,75y,90t/data=!3m8!1e2!3m6!1s-Ld67eN0Q1PU/V-gdL823hPI/AAAAAAAALjg/pA8ByuyhZ4ETUli4Ix8sGa-duZju9suTQCJkC!2e4!3e12!6s//lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Ld67eN0Q1PU/V-gdL823hPI/AAAAAAAALjg/pA8ByuyhZ4ETUli4Ix8sGa-duZju9suTQCJkC/w203-h152-k-no/!7i4160!8i3120!4m8!1m2!2m1!1sTuscaloosa+restaurants!3m4!1s0x0:0xd816cd52cf553690!8m2!3d33.2158273!4d-87.57315!6m1!1e1), and many other downtown Tuscaloosa establishments (that I’ve sampled and can vouch for! [Tuscaloosa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuscaloosa,_Alabama) has some history going back to the early 1800s and is a very pleasant place to spend time. It is also on the [Black Warrior River](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/uv?site_no=02465005), [Water Budget Summary here](https://cida.usgs.gov/nwc/#!waterbudget/achuc/031601130201).

A workshop dinner will be held on Wednesday 21 June. Drinks at the Levee Bar and Grill at 6 pm followed by dinner at Dreamland BBQ at 7 pm.
