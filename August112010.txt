UC1 has is at the stage of making the choice of SOS implementation. It has been decided that for the first milestone, the standard 52 North SOS and client will be used. This will allow a demonstration to be hopefully done in Toulouse. This would allow the sharing of cross-border data between France and Germany as planned.
