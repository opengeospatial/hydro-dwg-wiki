---++ Abstract

This use case involves the delivery of information required to help determine the flow of groundwater within a particular terrain, likely for input into a computational flow modeling software, and model results. It involves the delivery of hydrogeologic and geophysical properties associated with hydrogeologic units (such as key aquifer properties), the delivery of observations related to those units, well characteristics (driller's log), information about the related water bodies and in some cases water use information.

---++ Entities (Features, Observations, Properties)

Entities depend on type of model and the discretion of modelers and scientists. They include all or a subset of the following
   * water wells:
      * _general_: id, source, location, elevation, length, water level, well purpose
      * _well construction_: drill date, well casing intervals, sealing component intervals, screen intervals
      * _logs_: depth interval, lithologies, porosity, hydraulic conductivity
      * _water quantity_: storage, water levels
   * aquifers:
      * _general_: name, area,
      * _geology_: formations, lithologies
      * _properties_: confinement, media, water storage, sediment thickness, aquifer thickness, porosity, conductivity
      * _water balance_: aquifer recharge, aquifer discharge
      * _water use_: yield, usage type
---++ Web Clients

There are many potential clients for receiving this information including, but not limited to: GSC Client, US NGWMN client, US state or local agency websites
