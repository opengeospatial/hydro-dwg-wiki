---++ *Action Plan*

Develop !GroundWater Interoperability Experiment 2:
   * Circulate to HDWG Call for Participation re: _developing_ *GWIE2 Activity Plan* (Boyan)
   * Develop <strong>GWIE2 Activity Plan </strong>and circulate to HDWG for review
   * Submit <strong>GWIE2 Actvity Plan </strong>to OCG for approval
   * Issue call for participation in GWIE2 (OGC)
---++ *Notes*
   * *Notetaker:* thanks to Nate Booth
   * *Presentations:* as above
   * *Discussion*
1. Three emphases in today's GW info model designs:
   * observations (Gavin)
   * geology (Eric)
   * water body (Tomasz)
2. Is there an interest in harmonizing these to one international model?
   * WMO wants an information model for groundwater (Uli / Irene)
   * INSPIRE could benefit eventually during revisions (Tomasz):
      * CGI expressed interest in hydrogeological domain model.
      * International Hydrogeological Association also expressed interest
   * <p>USGS, GSC, CSIRO all express interest</p>
 3. who is the target audience? (Boyan)
   * decision maker: properties include aquifer storage, yield, and other water use
   * scientist: more regard to geologic properties
   * consultant: focus on observations
   * public: focus on wells
4. Options for having OGC solicit interest in developing a GW feature model (Arctur):
   * Interoperability Experiment (self-funded)
   * RFI (costs $$)
