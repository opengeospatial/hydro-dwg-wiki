   * Use case 2 and 3 to organize follow up meeting to further refine workplans
   * Follow up on idea of surface water interop day towards the end of the IE.

---+++Telecons
It was agreed that telecons would happen weekly with ad-hoc use case specific ones organised on an as needs basis. The focus for the telecons will be the management of the IE and cross use case linkages. Work will be done outside these telecons.

---+++Issues
Two additional work packages have been identified
   * Evaluation of candidate feature models including GRDC Metadata profile and the INSPIRE Hydrography data-model.
   * Evaluation of candidate vocabularies including WMO CBS, CUAHSI, and others.

We were not able to work out the best way to get this work done at the meeting and will defer them until a little later in the IE. It was stressed through that the a consistent approach across the IE is desirable and consistency within a use case is a must.
